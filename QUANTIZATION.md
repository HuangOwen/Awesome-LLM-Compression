The motivation is protecting only 1% of sliant weighs can retain the performance. Then, AWQ aims to search for the optimal per-channel scaling $`s^* = \arg\min_{s} \left\Vert Q \left( W \cdot \text{diag}(s) \right) \left( \text{diag}(s)^{-1} \cdot X \right) - W X \right\Vert`$ to protect the salient weights by observing the activation.

To address it, Outlier Suppression+ (OS+), a PTQ framework, is proposed with channel-wise shifting for asymmetry and channel-wise scaling for concentration. Also, they propose a fast and stable scheme to calculate the hyperparameters within the shifting and scaling.

This findings suggest a shift in PTQ strategies. These findings indicate that we should emphasis more on optimizing inference speed rather than focusing on outlier preservation. <br />#Analysis #Evaluation #Finding |
